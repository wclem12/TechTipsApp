# TechTipsApp
This Android App was developed for the Muncie Public Library from the fall of 2012 until spring of 2013. It was a collaborative project between two other students, myself, and the liaison at the library for our senior Software Engineering course. It was developed in JQuery and also used HTML, CSS, and XML to store and parse data related to the tech tips.

The app collected various technical tips, ranging from MS Word to general Internet or computer tips, as .png images. The app organized the tips by category and allowed patrons of the public library to view the tips.
